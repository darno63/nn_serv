# Infrastructure

Use this directory for infrastructure automation. Suggested layout:

- `lambda/` for Lambda Cloud REST API workflows and notes.
- `ansible/` for configuring provisioned machines (drivers, containers, monitoring).
- `terraform/` for other cloud IaC modules if you add them later.

Document required environment variables (cloud credentials) in each subfolder.
